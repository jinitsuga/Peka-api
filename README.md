# What's Peka, and why?

Peka (from Finn mythology Pekko/Pekka, god of crops) is a very simple social network, with the intention of allowing people that grow vegetables/fruits in their gardens to trade with each other, since it's very easy to have excess of X or Y vegetable while not being able to grow or have enough of another one, and where we live, it's quite common for people to plant at least one or two things in their garden.
Although I didn't have the knowledge to start tackling it when I started my coding journey, I thought it'd be an interesting thing to do, but now's the time! I also brought a great friend of mine along with me on this journey, since everything is more fun with friends, and he'll be taking care of most of the backend while I study Node, which will allow me to pick his brain about some of the stuff. A challenging-enough project that'll be fun to create, and potentially leave something useful for our community in the process.
